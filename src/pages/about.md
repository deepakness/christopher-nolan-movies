Christopher Nolan is a writer, producer, and director who has made a name for himself in the world of blockbuster cinema. He is known for his unorthodox approach to filmmaking, which some have called "mind-bending" and others have called "a waste of time."

But whatever you think about his movies, there's no denying that Nolan is a master of his craft. He has directed some of the most iconic films of our time: [Inception](/posts/movie-inception/) (2010), [Interstellar](/posts/movie-interstellar/) (2014), [Dunkirk](/posts/movie-dunkirk/) (2017), and many more.

Nolan was born in London in 1970. His father worked as an advertising executive while his mother stayed at home to raise Christopher and his three siblings. Nolan studied English literature at University College London before moving on to study screenwriting at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles.

After graduating from college in 1993, Nolan wrote several short films that were nominated for various awards before he was hired as assistant director on two low-budget films: [Following](/posts/movie-following/) (1998) and [Memento](/posts/movie-memento/) (2000). These early successes led him to direct Insomnia (2002) starring Al Pacino and Hillary Swank—which was nominated for Best Director at the Golden Globes.
