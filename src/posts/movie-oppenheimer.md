## Oppenheimer - Movie Summary

"Oppenheimer" is a 2023 epic biographical thriller directed and written by Christopher Nolan, based on the 2005 biography "American Prometheus" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. The film charts the compelling life journey of American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed by Cillian Murphy, predominantly focusing on his pivotal role in the Manhattan Project during WWII and his subsequent downfall following the 1954 security hearing. The film's star-studded cast includes Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife, Matt Damon as Manhattan Project lead Leslie Groves, and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, a member of the US Atomic Energy Commission, among others, creating a rich tapestry of characters that shape Oppenheimer's life and career.

The film traces Oppenheimer's trajectory from his anxiety-ridden doctoral years in Cambridge in 1926, through his burgeoning teaching career in the US and tumultuous personal life, to his recruitment by U.S. Army General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon) in 1942 to spearhead the Manhattan Project amid the pressures of WWII. After clearing doubts about any communist sympathies, Oppenheimer leads the endeavor to develop an atomic bomb, catalyzed by Nazi Germany's advancements in nuclear fission research. As an innovative addition to Nolan‚Äôs oeuvre, "Oppenheimer" is presented in black-and-white IMAX film photography for the first time, using a plethora of practical effects and minimal digital manipulation. The film went on to become a global success, grossing over $853 million and achieving acclaim for the performances, screenplay, and visual elements.
