## Prestige - Movie Summary

Christopher Nolan's "The Prestige" is a gripping film set in the Victoria era that revolves around a ferocious rivalry between two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). The film begins with a tragic incident during a magic trick, which ignites a charged competition between the two. Their rivalry goes beyond professional jealousy as it becomes an obsessive test of intellectual might, whereby not only do they seek to outdo each other, but they also aim to sabotage each other's performances.

Gradually, the competition turns lethal when both men start risking everything to perform the ultimate illusion. Their hunger for supremacy involves them in a dangerous game of deceit, sacrifice, and violation of ethical boundaries. This hunger intensifies to such a level that they willingly place their loved ones in jeopardy while their own personalities start to dissolve into their stage characters. The deeper they descend into obsession, the higher the stakes become. 

The Prestige, with its multiple layers of storytelling and mystery, cinematically explores the human obsession with perfection and the consequence of hubris. The film works its way through the intricate labyrinths of deceit and desperation until its shocking climax -- a denouement that forces us to question the very nature of reality and illusion. A psychological thriller at its core, Nolan's narrative masterfully intertwines themes of obsession, sacrifice, and the dangerous lengths one may go to remain the best at their craft.
