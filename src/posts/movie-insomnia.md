## Insomnia - Movie Summary

Insomnia is a 2002 psychological thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank. The film takes place in Alaska and centers on two Los Angeles detectives who are sent to Alaska to investigate the murder of a 17-year-old girl.

When the detectives arrive in Alaska, they find it difficult to adjust to the local time zone, which results in insomnia. One detective begins seeing things that are not there, and the other detective suspects that his partner is hallucinating due to sleep deprivation.
