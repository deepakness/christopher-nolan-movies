## Insomnia - Movie Summary

Insomnia is a 2002 psychological thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Al Pacino, Robin Williams, and Hilary Swank. The film takes place in Alaska and centers on two Los Angeles detectives who are sent to Alaska to investigate the murder of a 17-year-old girl.
